# Model Residual Explorer

## Description

The Model Residual Explorer is a Streamlit application designed to visualize and analyze model residuals for both regression and classification tasks. This tool helps users understand model performance, identify potential weaknesses, and assess model robustness by interactively exploring residual plots and performance metrics.

This application utilizes a synthetic dataset to provide a hands-on educational experience, allowing users to grasp the concepts of model residuals and their interpretation in a practical context. Whether you are working on regression or classification problems, this explorer offers valuable insights into your model's behavior.

## Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system.  Then, install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1.  **Save the Python script:** Save the provided Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `app.py`).
2.  **Run the Streamlit app:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the application:** Once the application is running, it will open in your web browser.
    - **Task Type Selection:** Choose between "Regression" and "Classification" tasks using the radio buttons in the sidebar.
    - **Explore Synthetic Data:** Observe the generated synthetic dataset and the distribution of the target variable.
    - **Analyze Residual Plots:** Examine the various plots generated, including:
        - Predicted vs. Actual Values (Regression)
        - Histogram of Residuals
        - Residuals vs. Feature (Selectable Feature)
        - Predicted Probabilities Histogram (Classification)
    - **Review Model Metrics:** Check the performance metrics displayed for both Regression and Classification tasks.

Follow the on-screen instructions and explore the different visualizations to understand model residuals and performance.
